            <h2>Why choose PTS K9</h2>
            <br><br>

            <p> We are driven by our passion to provide a bespoke service for our clients, and make special efforts to
                get
                to know you and your family so that we can understand your individual needs. </p> <br><br>

            <p> We learn about all our individual clients and their lifestyles and seek to match them with the ideal
                family
                protection dog or puppy and offer a lifetime of support to all clients who purchase a dog from
                us. </p> <br><br>

            <p> We maintain an honest and realistic policy about what we can achieve with your dog and deliver every
                time.
                Some dogs have the capabilities for protection work and some don't, but either way we will tell you from
                the
                offset after we make an assessment of your dog. </p> <br><br>

            <p> We provide world class protection dogs that are friendly and calm unless a threat is perceived by the
                dog
                which it has been trained to recognise or it has been commanded to come to the defense of its owner all
                of
                our dogs are trained family friendly and stable. </p> <br><br>

            <p> Through our K9 family matching process, the dogâ€™s welfare is always a key concern. We will only part
                ways
                with a dog if a lasting relationship with the client is guaranteed, and an after-care regime follows
                every
                purchase. This is to ensure the happiness of both the dog, and the client. </p> <br><br>

            <p> We do not view training protection and security dogs as a sport, and would never place a sporting dog in
                a
                family home as these dogs are not trained and conditioned to take on real situations when a person's
                life
                maybe in danger . This is bad practise, and morally wrong. </p> <br><br>

            <br><br><br><br>
            <h2>PTS K9 Training Methods</h2>
            <br><br>

            <p>At PTSk9 we use the most up-to-date in methods and equipment for training the many dogs that are brought
                to us to learn, we use a balance of reward based training using favorite foods, games or toys, and
                praises as well as affection as motivation for the dogs to learn. <br><br>
                We also use corrections for dogs but
                only after a dog has fully comprehended and understood what action it is that is required from the dog
                when it is commanded, thereafter if the dog is easily distracted or not complient the dog is corrected
                through the leash with simple techniques which are neither harmful or painful to the dog. This creates a
                balance of both positive and negative reenforcement to keep the dog reliable and obedient in both
                private and public settings.</p>
