            <p class="question">What is the difference between a <b>guard dog</b> and a <b>protection dog</b>?</p>

        </div>

        <p class="answer">The answer is important for you to know the difference before you make a decision and buy a
            puppy. Think of it this way, a guard dog will guard your property and a protection dog will protect you and
            your family. <br><br>

            A guard dog is trained specifically to be a working dog, not a pet. They are used as police dogs or military
            dogs and cannot "turn off" their training. Guard dogs can be trained to work at 3 distinct levels of
            security. <br><br>

            Alarm Dog- This is a large breed with a deep, threatening bark. He will sound the alarm when someone
            approaches, but will take no action. In many cases, the alarm dogs bark is enough to deter unwanted
            visitors. <br><br>

            Sentry Dog- A guard dog used as a sentry is most often used to guard the outside of a large property, such
            as a warehouse or shipyard. The dog is free to roam on his own without instruction from his owner. Because
            they are trained to attack anyone who trespasses, they are the best possible protection for this type of
            situation. <br><br>

            Attack Dog- An attack trained guard dog is trained to attack and even kill when given the command of his
            handler. These dogs meant to be used as police K-9 or military service dogs. Dogs trained at this level are
            not sociable at any level and are not suitable as pets. <br><br>

            Protection dogs are family dogs that will protect and defend their family in any situation they feel is
            threatening. Some of the most popular breeds for protection are Rottweilers, German Shepherds and Giant
            Schnauzers. The Doberman is the only working dog bred specifically as a protection dog. These breeds are
            extremely loyal and become true family members. <br><br> They can be socialized with children and other
            pets, as
            well
            as other family, friends and neighbors. These dogs should never be trained specially to do what comes
            naturally to them. They should be bred with special consideration for their natural instinct to protect.
            These breeds do however, need to be obedience trained and need to know their position in the family. They
            can be dominant, so it is important to establish your alpha role. Exercise is extremely important if you
            want to have a well behaved, well-adjusted protection dog. These dogs need plenty of activity because they
            are big, physical animals with lots of energy.

            The main distinction between a guard dog and a protection dogs is ultimately in the training. It is always
            best to seek a professional when you have determined what you need from your working companion.</p>

            <p class="question">Are protection dogs safe?</p>
        </div>
        <p class="answer"> A well trained protection dog is much safer than a dog that has had
            no training. This is due to the fact that much like every human can punch, every dog can bite. However, a
            trained family protection dog understands right from wrong, and when biting is or is not allowed. A trained
            protection dog will understand that biting is only allowed when their handler gives them permission to do
            so, and will also reliably release on command. In contrast to this, and untrained dog will bite on impulse.
            If effectively trained and handled, a protection dog is very safe.</p>

            <span><img class="question-icon" src="img/request.svg" alt=""></span>
            <p class="question">If I buy a fully trained protection dog from PTSK9, will it be OK with my children,
                other
                pets and animals?</p>
        </div>
        <p class="answer">Yes! Part of our matching process ensures that your dog will be OK with everyone in your
            household. Our personal protection dogs are raised in homes around children and conditioned to be loving and
            tolerant. We socialize and train our dogs not only with other dogs of all sizes, but also with other animals
            including birds, horses, cats and rabbits (upon request)</p>

            <p class="question">Can you do any discounts on the prices for boarding and training our dog? </p>
        </div>
        <p class="answer"> <b>We only do discounts for those who wish to train or buy more than one dog at a time</b> .
            Raising
            dogs, boarding or training dogs takes alot of effort work and time. This involves feeding and watering
            numerous dogs many times a day, bathing dogs, washing and cleaning kennels, bowls and equipment, and toilet
            runs many times a day and even trips to the vet if the need occurs. <br><br>We often have to deflea and
            deworm the
            dogs that come to us and training them is a huge mental and physical work as well as responsibility and has
            taken more than 10 years of study and experience to gain the knowledge needed to be able to train all of the
            different types of dogs and breeds that are often brought to us (sometimes with behavioral issues) gaining
            both the knowledge and equipment needed to train the dogs coming to us has cost many thousands of pounds and
            still costs us up to this day to maintain and develop not to mention paying all of our staff.
            <br><br>
            Sadly some
            people don't understand the amount of work and investment that goes into our profession to get the dogs up
            to
            standard
            and under the control of their handlers Finally to mention the risk taken by all of us dog trainers, decoys
            and other staff members who are needed to care for and train all of the dogs for security and
            protection, not
            to mention the dogs that come with unwanted aggression and possessive behaviors.
