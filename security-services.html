            PTSK9 is able to offer a fully comprehensive range of security solutions. Since the company was established
            2002, weâ€™ve had considerable growth ever since and now serve clients internationally. PTS offer a Security
            Risk Management service which enables us to identify, evaluate and analyse the security risks involved with
            your business, project or premises. Once the evaluation is complete we are able to tailor a K9 security
            solution suitable to your needs and implement it fully to give you complete peace of mind.
